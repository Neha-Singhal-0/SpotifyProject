# Spotify Clone

A simple, non-functional clone of the Spotify home page created using HTML and CSS. This project is intended for learning purposes, focusing on replicating the look and feel of the Spotify home page.

- **Responsive Design**: The page adjusts to different screen sizes, providing a basic responsive layout.

## Technologies Used

    ```

3. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.

## Usage
